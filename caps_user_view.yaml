# This capabilities file includes data to obtain a default user view 
# preference classification based on a User-Agent String.
# Motivation: In most modern mobile browsers the user can change the the 
# User-Agent such to signal their preference of the default use case.
# On choosing 'desktop' they prefer to obtain a bigscreen view over 
# the a possible default 'mobile' view. 
# The capabilities provided here try to take this into account.
